Toastmaster Brian did a great job checking in on everyone and preparing the agenda for tonight's meeting

Speakers sent speech introductions and evaluation ahead of time

Members logged on and were ready to start on time

Members who were not able to make it, did communicate ahead of time and let the Toastmaster know

Members with roles were ready to participate and introduced their roles properly

We kickoff well as a club. We have a friendly vibe. Yet we had no visitors or guests

Members had name tags that identified their role in the meeting, and more specifically with the OPEN tag making it easier for the Table Topics master to choose who to pick for their questions

Our speaker was ready with her speech. Very informative speech. https://drifitz.itch.io/brickroll

Meeting theme: Wisdom 

Meeting Word of Day: Thirsty

Timer demonstrated a creative way for that 30 seconds time check, but I am not certain that the GREEN came out much. 

Toastmaster transitions were smooth and succinct

Table topics master ran quite the table topics session and did a great job with active listening and transitioning from one question to the other. Had 5 questions and chose the OPEN contestants properly

Everyone's audio and video worked well and no technical glitches or issues.

Speech Evaluator, John - very effective and offered a good advice at the end as far as developing the speech for a professional reason

AH counter evaluation was super fun
Grammarian and Word of Day report did well to include remarks from our meeting
